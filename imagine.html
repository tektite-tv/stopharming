      <h1>Imagine Therapuetic Services</h1>

      <div class="red-text">
        I was a client of Imagine Therapuetic Services from Feb. 2021-July 2025 (4+ years of my life, age 24-28)<br>
        I was dependent on them for everything in my daily living.<br>
        They never respected my independence, agency, or autonomy.<br>
        Since day one of living in their 24/7 staff supported housing arrangement I knew it was not the right fit but was coerced to remain living with them by family and circumstances out of my control.
      </div>
      <div class="white-text">
        Imagine Therapuetic Services often weaponzied my medical history against me through coercive conditional care.<br>
        I have been saying since May 2025 that I was being neglected by them.<br>
        They never listened to any of my concerns about my quality of life, and discarded my humanity like trash.<br>
        You can see my entire Google Drive folder of documentation, as I anticipated Imagine would kick me out. I was trying everything I could think to do to advocate for my rights and they completely disregarded my boundaries as an adult in their supposed care.<br>
        Link to the Drive Folder found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pvUYpBzoYhTSPigD5ffIcxf1YTxxTkba?usp=drive_link">HERE</a>
